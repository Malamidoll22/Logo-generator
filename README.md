Hello, this is the Logo generator.

Once you give a prompt, 2 different AI's will generate 4 different logo's and they will be automatically uploaded to a CDN.

To start, go to secrets and add your openAI API key.

Or if it isn't hosted on Replit, add it in the .env file

# Config.json
`favicon`: A direct url to a image. This is used as favicon \
`title`: The name that is used as website title. For example the index is `<title> - Home`. \
`lockdown`: If you enable lockdown and restart the repl the webserver will only display a lockdown message. This feature was added to make sure no one spams logo's while I am not online.
